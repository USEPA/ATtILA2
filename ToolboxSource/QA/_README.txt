Use these scripts to run all Analytical Tools Interface for Landscape Analyses (ATtILA) tools with multiple permutations for automated QA testing. Each tool has a stand-alone run script which calls the toolbox using various parameter combinations.

Users will need to update parameters.py with file paths and file names if not using the standard ATtILA QA database.

Test dictionaries are found in inputDictionaries.py
