    **Description:**
        This tool intersects reporting units with buffered features that contain the reporting unit ID. The buffer size (in map 
        units) is determined by the user. A new feature class is created that can be used as a reporting unit theme to 
        calculate metrics near the features. It is useful for generating metrics near water quality sample points where 
        watersheds that drain to the sample point are available.

        * *inFeatures* - feature class that will be buffered
        * *repUnits* - reporting units that will be used for the clip
        * *outFeatures* - a feature class (without full path) that will be created as the output of this tool
        * *bufferDist* - distance in the units of the spatial reference of the input data to buffer
        * *ruIDField* - a field that exists in repUnits that contains a unique identifier for the reporting units.  
        * *ruLinkField* - a field that exists in the inFeatures that contains reporting unit IDs, linking buffered features
                            to reporting units

    """Returns a feature class that contains only those portions of each reporting unit that are within a buffered 
        distance of a layer - the buffered features may be any geometry
    **Description:**
        This tool intersects reporting units with buffered features that fall within the reporting unit. The buffer size (in map 
        units) is determined by the user. A new feature class is created that can be used as a reporting unit theme to 
        calculate metrics with the buffered areas. It is useful for generating metrics near streams that fall within the
        reporting unit.
        
        This tool makes the assumption that there is no attribute that links the features to be buffered with the 
        reporting units.  Because of this, it cannot buffer all the features at once - it must iterate through each
        reporting unit, first clipping features to the reporting unit boundaries, then buffering only those features
        and then finally clipping the buffers again to the reporting unit.  If the features can be linked to reporting
        units via an attribute, it should be faster to use the bufferFeaturesByID tool instead.
    **Arguments:**
        * *inFeatures* - one or more feature class that will be buffered
        * *repUnits* - reporting units that will be used for the clip

    **Description:**
        This tool buffers features and identifies the reporting unit that the buffered areas fall within. The buffer 
        size (in linear units) is determined by the user. A new feature class is created that can be used as a reporting 
        unit theme to calculate metrics with the buffered areas. It is useful for generating metrics near streams that 
        fall within the reporting unit.
        
        This tool ignores the boundaries between reporting units when creating buffers. If buffered areas should be
        restricted to the reporting unit where the input feature is located and not extend into nearby reporting units,
        the bufferFreaturesByIntersect should be used instead.
    **Arguments:**
        * *inFeatures* - one or more feature class that will be buffered
        * *repUnits* - reporting units that will be used for the clip
        * *outFeatures* - a feature class (without full path) that will be created as the output of this tool
        * *bufferDist* - distance in the units of the spatial reference of the input data to buffer
        * *unitID* - a field that exists in repUnits that contains a unique identifier for the reporting units. 
        * *cleanupList* - a list object for tracking intermediate datasets for cleanup at the user's request.

    """Returns a list of merged feature classes. List item one is polygon features, item two is polyline features, and item three is point features.
    **Description:**
        This tool accepts the parameterAsText string of feature layers from a multiple value input parameter. It separates those layers
        by shape type, and merges them into three new possible feature classes (polygon, polyline, and/or point) projected to the environment's 
        Output coordinate system. Before the merge operation, ATtILA attempts to determine if a datum transformation is needed and selects a suitable
        transformation method. If no feature layer of a particular class is found, a string with invalid filename characters is returned
        in the list position for that shape type. Using that string with the arcpy function Exists(), a boolean FALSE will be returned. If a 
        FALSE is returned, further feature class operations can be ignored for that feature class type.

    **Arguments:**
        * *inFeatures* - one or more feature class that will be merged
        * *fileNameBase* - a string (without full path) that will be used as the filename prefix to create the outputs of this tool
        * *cleanupList* - a list object for tracking intermediate datasets for cleanup at the user's request
        ' 'logFile' - optional file used to record processing steps 
        
    **Returns:**
