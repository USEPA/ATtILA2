## Overview

ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is an Esri ArcGIS toolbox that allows users to easily calculate many common landscape metrics. GIS expertise is not required, but some experience with ArcGIS is recommended. Three metric groups (toolsets) are currently included in ATtILA: [Landscape Characteristics](<v3_Landscape-Characteristics>), [People in the Landscape](<v3_People-in-the-Landscape>), and [Riparian Characteristics](<v3_Riparian-Characteristics>), along with a [Utilities](<v3_Utilities>) section. ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is written using the Python programming language and is designed to accommodate spatial data from a variety of sources.

## Credits 

Python code for ATtILA was written by Don Ebert (EPA), Michael Jackson (former EPA), Baohong Ji (former Woolpert), and Torrin Hultgren (GDIT), with special assistance from Ellen D'Amico (EPA), Doug Browning (former EPA Student Services Contractor), Allison Killea (former Student Services Contractor), and Jacob Tafrate (EPA ORISE Participant).

David Gottlieb (former EPA Student Services Contractor) wrote the code for the Land Cover Coding Editor.

The original ATtILA ArcView extension tool was written in Avenue code by Don Ebert (EPA) and Tim Wade (former EPA) with assistance from Dennis Yankee (Tennessee Valley Authority, Public Power Institute) who wrote code for the PCTIA_RD metric.

The following programmers were not directly involved with the project, but gave permission for their code to be incorporated into the original ATtILA and we greatly appreciate their generosity:
