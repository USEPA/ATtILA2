The information provided here is for version 3.0 of the ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro toolbox. This stable release and earlier versions are available at https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/releases or as a zipped file at https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/attila-toolbox. 

For more information on the ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro toolbox, see our [wiki page](https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki), or [factsheet](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-05/Attilatoolsets.pdf).


## Overview

ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is an Esri ArcGIS toolbox that allows users to easily calculate many common landscape metrics. GIS expertise is not required, but some experience with ArcGIS is recommended. Three metric groups (toolsets) are currently included in ATtILA: [Landscape Characteristics](https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki/v3_Landscape-Characteristics), [People in the Landscape](https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki/v3_People-in-the-Landscape), and [Riparian Characteristics](https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki/v3_Riparian-Characteristics), along with a [Utilities](https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki/v3_Utilities) section. ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is written using the Python programming language and is designed to accommodate spatial data from a variety of sources.



## Requirements

The ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro toolbox was developed for ArcGIS Pro 3.0 or later. It has been tested successfully on versions up to 3.3. 

In ArcGIS Pro 3.4, several ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro tools have failed when spaces are in the toolbox's file path. All tools operate as expected during testing when no spaces are found. 

The Spatial Analyst or 3D Analyst extensions are required.



## Installation

The ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro toolbox can be added to a new or existing ArcGIS Pro project.
